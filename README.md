# Bionic Talent - Technical Assessment

This repository contains the solution for the technical assessment provided by Bionic Talent for the WordPress and Shopify Developer position.

## Project Overview

This project implements a responsive webpage based on two provided design files: `Assessment.jpg` and `Assessment-wider.jpg`. The goal was to replicate the design using only HTML and CSS, adhering to the provided guidelines.

## Guidelines Followed

1. **Technologies Used**:
    - HTML
    - CSS (No CSS frameworks were used)

2. **CSS Implementation**:
    - Flexbox and Grid were used for layout structure.
    - No floats or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation were used.
    - Focused on achieving pixel-perfect accuracy based on the provided designs.

3. **Responsive Design**:
    - The page is fully responsive, with custom decisions made for smaller screen widths.
    - The wider design (`Assessment-wider.jpg`) was used to ensure that the background extends for larger screens while the "content frame" remains centered with a max width.

4. **Links**:
    - The circular images and the map are linked using `href="#"`.
    - Paragraph text styled in red and images under the "Helpful Heating and Air Articles" section are also links.

5. **Cross-browser/device Support**:
    - Tested in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge.
    - Responsive across iPhone Safari, iPad Safari, and Android Chrome.
    - Supports a minimum viewport width of 320px.
